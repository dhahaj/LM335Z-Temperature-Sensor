This helps elimainate noise and provide better resolution on the analog port read.  \r\n\r\nDependencies: The PrintEx library. Allows for easier printing to the Serial port. See https://github.com/Chris--A/PrintEx#printex-library-for-arduino-.\r\n\r\nDocumentation: View the datasheet for the LM335Z here -  http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm335.pdf.\r\n\r\n",
