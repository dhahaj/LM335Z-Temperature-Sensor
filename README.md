# LM335Z-Temperature-Sensor
Arduino example sketch for using the LM335Z temperature sensor 

The sketch is written for use on the Uno models with the analogReference set to EXTERNAL and the aref pin connected to 3V3 power. This helps elimainate noise and provide better resolution on the analog port read.  

Dependencies: The PrintEx library. Allows for easier printing to the Serial port. See https://github.com/Chris--A/PrintEx#printex-library-for-arduino-.
